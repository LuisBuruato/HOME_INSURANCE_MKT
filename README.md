1.- BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING .
Using data mining tools I will be able to estimate  among 1003 customers which ones are  likely to buy a home insurance and which ones are not , based on 85 predictor variables that will be meaningful to take a right decision. Furthermore, I will be able to perform a Decision Cost/Benefit Analysis.  Firstly ,  I audited  the TRAINING DATA SET  of 8819 records to confirm that in fact there are 8819 records  and that they can be analyzed.

1.1.-The Data audit node gives me a general  vision about how my data behaves. For example : the home_insurance variable has more 0s than 1s , this tells me that most of the people rejected the home_insurance policy. We look this behavior in Figure 1.1
